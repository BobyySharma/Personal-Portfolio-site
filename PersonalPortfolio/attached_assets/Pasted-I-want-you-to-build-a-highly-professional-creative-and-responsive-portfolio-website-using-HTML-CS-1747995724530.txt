I want you to build a highly professional, creative, and responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React + Tailwind CSS if preferred). This should look like something made by a top-tier developer (like an IITian). It should be clean, minimalistic, and have modern design elements like:

Interactive project showcase cards with hover effects and modal preview

Typewriter effect for the tagline in the hero section

Sticky navbar with animated active section indicator

Responsive design for all devices (desktop/tablet/mobile)

SEO-ready with clean meta tags and Open Graph tags
